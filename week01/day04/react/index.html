    <h1>React Components</h1>

    <p>Components are the smallest, yet most fundamental part of React. They’re similar,
      in concepts, to things like widgets and modules. React defines itself as a
      library for building user interfaces. As such, when you think of a user interface
      you want to build (with React), you need to think of it in terms of the smallest
      possible components that you can define.</p>

    <p>These components include code which defines how DOM elements are created and
      how users can interact with them. Components can be defined purely in JavaScript
      or they can be defined in a superset (or extended variation) of JavaScript called
      JSX. If you decide to use JSX for your component definitions, you may also need
      a compiler application, but we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
