QUESTIONS

>Why make a folder called js that contains .html children? Better naming protocol?

No standard, but you can separate into services, directives, features(like pages),
and assets.

>Which of these is called a directive?

When you use .directive in your js and <directive-name> in your html.

>Other use cases for .constant?

Any time you want something that won't change that you can inject. You could write
a service for it but that is just more work.

>Does chaining methods work because the immediate parent doesn't have the method

Any service you want to use you need to inject. You can also inject functions from
your resolve object. Also $scope and other things from your libraries. It's to
stop pages from taking forever to load. You can also inject constants.

>Am I supposed to declare/assign firebaseRef somewhere?

No

>What does resolve do?

Waits to load page/controller until the data asked for is returned. Risky because
it can freeze.

>Step 6 - setting up resolve. Isn't a property whose value is a function called a
>method? Did I set this up right? What does "take in threadService" mean?

>Do you always add $scope to every controller? If not, why not?

Not if you use "controller as" syntax.

>What does "Add pass in threadsRef" mean? Is that (hopefully) a typo?

Yes, it was just asking you to pass in aka inject threadsRef.

>What is "required" for inputs?

>Shouldn't it be ng-sref not ng-href?

>What is ng-disabled="newCommentForm.$invalid"?
