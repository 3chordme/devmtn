ARRAYS - JS NOTES

Objects are sometimes called associative arrays. The order of the keys is not specific.
key-value pairs.

An array can hold strings, numbers, Booleans, objects, and other arrays.
An array of arrays is called a matrix.

Arrays are a built in object. The order of an array is specific.

var colors = [];
var colors = new Array;

colors.push("red", "green"); //adds items to the end of an array.
colors.pop(); //removes one item from the back of the array, returns that item
var removed = colors.pop();

colors.unshift("blue", "pink"); //adds to the front of the array
var removed = colors.shift(); //removes and returns one item from the front of the array.

myArray.join(); = returns a string made up of the array items separated by commas. converts values to strings first.
myArray.join(" "); = ...separated by spaces
myArray.join("\n"); = ...separated by line breaks
myArray.join("\t"); = ...separated by tab

colors.indexOf("red"); returns the index number of the value specified

"slice" is a method that does not effect the array, just returns a part of the array.

var favoriteColors = colors.slice(<index of 1st element in slice>, <index AFTER last item in slice>);

If the second argument is not given, it equals the length of the area (so it returns the rest of the array)
If the first argument is negative, it starts counting from the back of the array and then acts normally.

"splice"

var removed = colors.splice(<index start>, <number to remove>); returns and removes elements

colors.splice(2, 0, "Hot Pink"); adds hot pink at 2nd index, removes nothing.

colors.reverse(); reverse the order of the array.

for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i])
}

//set comparison operator as < not <= b/c # of final index is array.length - 1.

if you use this syntax, you will get strings of the index numbers, because the index numbers
are properties of the array object.

for (var color in colors) {
  console.log(color);
}

//gives you "0" "1" "2" etc. as strings not numbers.

To access the value of an array, indicate the index # using syntax like objects

colors[0];
