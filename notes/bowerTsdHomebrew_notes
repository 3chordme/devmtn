install bower

npm install -g bower

make a folder called bower

go into that folder

bower install jquery

(now there is a folder called jquery inside of your bower folder)

bower install angular

(now there is a folder called angular inside of your bower folder)

what if you don't want to push all of those libraries to github? let's say you delete them from your bower folder.

bower init

name? bower
description?
main file? app.js
what types of modules does this package expose?
keywords?
authors? you
license?MIT
homepage?
set currently installed components as dependencies? Y
...private? No

Looks good? Yes

creates a file bower.json
javascript notation file

bower install jquery angular --save

pulls the packages and inserts them into the bower.json file. now you have dependencies.
it basically says this project wants to have these libraries.

now if you don't have those libraries present (like let's say you just got them from github)
you just have to say bower install, it will see the libraries needed and install

for visual studio
npm install -g tsd
tsd init
creates a tsd.json file
tsd install jquery angular --save
now visual studio knows all of the jquery and angular commands
