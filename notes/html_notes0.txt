HTML NOTES 0

Seperation of concerns (?)

typically don't want to use w3 schools. stackoverflow and mdn are good.

html goes in the head because it would load weird if it was in the body, flashing
the crappy html style first.

when you have a problem, open your developer tools (right click, inspect element)
in chrome (best tools)

when you want to apply one style to two diff attributes, use ','
' ' is ancestral (?)

you can apply to classes to an element
<div style="class: class1 class2">

class2 will be applied over class1 if there is a conflict

universal selector has the lowest degree of specificity, 0.

apparently points are assigned like 100 for id and 10 for class

universal selector

type selector - eg p, and pseudo-elements

class selector - .

id selector - #

content is padded inside div, margin is outside div

margin: 0 auto;
  means top bottom 0, right left auto. auto is only for left and right.

margin: 0;
  means all 0

display: none
  hides it.

font-family: mainFont, backupfont;
  use comma to set a backup

if you set width in %, you can also set max-width and min-width so it doesn't get
too ridiculous.
