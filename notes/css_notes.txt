CSS

Cascading Style Sheets. Gives HTML its style, its look/feel.

selector {
  property: value;
}

When there are conflicting properties, specificity wins. If there is no conflict,
all properties apply. Tag < class < id.

kind of liks a version number:
1.0.2.4
inline.id.class.type
(the further left is outranks the others)

.class {
}

#id {
}

generally bad practice to use id. only should be used for ONE item.

Fun: the technical name for a pound sign or hashtag is an octothorpe

property/value examples:

width: #px
height: #px
background-color:
background-image:
color:
font-size:
text-align:
line-height:
