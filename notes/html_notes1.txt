media queries are almost like an if statement for css

new things: input, button, form

<form>
<input type="button" name="name" value="submit">
<button type="button" name="button">Also submit</button>
<input type="text" placeholder="your name" />
</form.

!important
  overrides specificity, should probably not be used..

normalize.css

*{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

use this for when you want your padding to be equal to your box, not get added around it.
makes sizing easier.
