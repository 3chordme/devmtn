Client is your browser and the computer with the webpage is the server when you
hear "client server."

Other clients can be your phone apps, or an applewatch, gaming consoles, etc.

http:// is the language, or protocol.

https:// same thing but "secure"

First request from client to server is just for html file, then makes requests for
script and link tags, and images. That's why you'll see a page load incrementally.
